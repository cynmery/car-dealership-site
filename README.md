This is a car dealership site that I first designed on InVision and then hard-coded the homepage. There are links on the homepage that will take you to the prototype of the other pages. 
The main focus on this project was to put usability design practices to the test and implement Web Content Accesibility Guidelines(WCAG) . The following steps were taken to  create the end result you see here: 

  1. Personas
  2. Customer Journey Maps
  3. Wireframes
  4. Prototypes
  5. Guerilla Testing
  6. Usability Testing with Users
  7. Heuristic Evaluation
